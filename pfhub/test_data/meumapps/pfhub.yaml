summary: >-
  This simulation was performed using a currently unreleased version of MEUMAPPS, developed at Oak Ridge National Lab. This simulation does not have any adaptivity in time or space.

  Spatial discretization: Fourier-spectral
  Temporal discretization:  Semi-implicit backward Euler
  Grid: 128x128
  Time step: 0.1 

  I think spatially this simulation is pretty well converged. As far as temporal convergence goes, there are some qualitative differences in the early evolution if I use smaller time steps but the energy evolution doesn't change much. This simulation runs until the system is quite near to equilibrium.
